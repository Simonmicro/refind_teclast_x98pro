# rEFInd config for Teclast x98 Pro Dual Boot

* Just copy-paste this into refind to have a working good looking, dual-boot, touch enabled bootloader :)
* You'll need only these files/folders inside your efi boot parititon:
```
drivers_x64
icons
os_android.png
os_windows.png
refind.conf
refind_x64.efi
tools_x64
```
